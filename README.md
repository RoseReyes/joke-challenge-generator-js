# Joke Generator Project Challenge

In the last video, we saw how to make a request to an API using the `XMLHttpRequest` object. In this video, we'll use the same technique to make a request to the [https://api.chucknorris.io/](https://api.chucknorris.io/) to get a random Chuck Norris joke and put it into the page. We will also create a button that will allow us to get a new joke.
